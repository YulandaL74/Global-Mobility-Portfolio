# Security Policy

Thank you for caring about the security of this project.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it privately so it can be fixed before public disclosure.

Preferred steps:
1. Open a private GitHub security advisory (if available) or
2. Create an issue titled "Security: [short description]" and set the repository visibility to private (or mark it for the maintainer only), or
3. Contact the repository owner (Yulanda Davis) directly via a private message on GitHub.

Please include:
- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce (including code snippets if helpful)
- Impact of the vulnerability
- Suggested fixes or mitigations (optional)

We will acknowledge reports within a few business days and work to resolve issues promptly.
