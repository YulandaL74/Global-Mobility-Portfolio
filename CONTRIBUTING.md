## Ways to contribute
- Open an issue to report a bug or request a feature.
- Submit a pull request (PR) with a small, focused change.
- Improve documentation or add examples.

## Basic workflow (easy and safe)
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a branch named using this pattern:
   - `fix/short-description` for bug fixes
   - `feat/short-description` for new features
   - `docs/short-description` for documentation only
3. Make small, focused commits. Use present-tense, imperative messages, for example:
   - "Fix typo in README"
   - "Add bug report template"
4. Push your branch to your fork and open a PR against `main` (or `add-initial-docs` if you're following the initial docs changes).
5. Wait for review and make any requested changes.

## Code style and simplicity
- Aim for simple, easy-to-read code.
- Use plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript or Python where appropriate — avoid complex frameworks unless necessary.
- Use 2 spaces for indentation and keep line lengths under ~100 characters.

## Tests and checks
- If there are tests, run them before opening a PR. If none exist, focus on clear explanations and small changes.
- Explain manual testing steps in your PR description.

## Communication
- Use GitHub issues for questions, bugs, and feature requests.
- Be respectful and patient in reviews.
