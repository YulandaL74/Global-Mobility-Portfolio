1. Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:
   - Using welcoming and inclusive language.
   - Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
   - Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
   - Showing empathy toward other community members.

2. Examples of unacceptable behavior:
